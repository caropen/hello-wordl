This is a fork of a variant of the popular world game. The original repository is found [**here**](https://github.com/lynn/hello-wordl). Play it [**here**](https://hellowordl.net/). This fork was created and adapted, such that always the same word is the solution to use it in a puzzle box, where it was accessed using a QR code. 

It's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) but you can play forever, and it is always the same result!

Play it [**here**](http://caropen.github.io/wedding-wordl.).
